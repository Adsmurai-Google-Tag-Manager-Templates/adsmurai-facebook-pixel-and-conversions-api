# Adsmurai Facebook Pixel & Conversions API

This Google Tag Manager custom tag for web containers helps with firing Facebook events via regular pixel and Conversions API.

## Installation

Install the template on your container from the [Community Template Gallery](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/owners/Adsmurai-Google-Tag-Manager-Templates/templates/adsmurai-facebook-pixel-and-conversions-api) following [these steps](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9454109?hl=en).

## How it works

Create as many tags as you want using this template. On each tag, fill all the fields you need to define your event and where to send it.

If you want to use this tag to send events to Facebook through Conversions API, it's recommended to create a Google Tag Manager's server container and import there the [Adsmurai Facebook Conversions API Client](https://github.com/Adsmurai-Google-Tag-Manager-Templates/adsmurai-facebook-conversions-api-client) and [Adsmurai Facebook Conversions API Tag](https://github.com/Adsmurai-Google-Tag-Manager-Templates/adsmurai-facebook-conversions-api-tag). These two templates will help you manage incoming events from the web container, like the ones sent with this template.
